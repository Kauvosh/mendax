This repository contains an experimental, not-yet-complete reverse-shell–style TCP communication system implemented in C. It leverages low-level Berkeley socket APIs to establish a bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server over TCP. The design focuses on testing basic remote command execution concepts, data transfer reliability, and connection handling in a controlled development environment.
